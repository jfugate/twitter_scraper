This script is for pulling all notable information from a given Twitter user.

**Installation**
pip install -r requirements.txt

**NOTE**
This utilizes environment variables to read in API keys. Create a shell script with the right variable names (and values) from twitter_scrape.py's set_creds section.

source envvars.sh

Once the keys are loaded into your environment, the script should be good to go.
